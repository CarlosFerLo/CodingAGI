# CodingAGI
Development of an AGI that has the power to code itself

## Objectives
This project aims to contribute on the advancement of ai, specialy when trying to use language models to code. We aim to create an AGI that can manage huge code repositoties and help developers and hopefully help and autonomously develop a general propouse AGI.

## Plan
* First we will add up a database of papers and analyse them to be able to design a LLM framework that can manage code repositories.
... TODO :)
* As a first step we will try to create a library for transforming python code into a json file that can be better managed by a LLM.
